02 Android LifeCycle Aware Components

- Most of the code is written inside Activity Lifecycle Methods - onCreate, onResume, onPause, etc
	Due to this Activity has multiple responsibilities
- But there are scenarios where we want to take actions based on activity life cycle
- For Ex
	Access the User's Location
	Playing Video
	Downloading Images
- LifeCycle Owner(Activities/ Fragments) / LifeCycle Observer(Components which look at others lifecycle)
