02 Android LifeCycle Aware Components

- Most of the code is written inside Activity Lifecycle Methods - onCreate, onResume, onPause, etc
	Due to this Activity has multiple responsibilities
- But there are scenarios where we want to take actions based on activity life cycle 
- For Ex
	Access the User's Location
	Playing Video
	Downloading Images
- LifeCycle Owner(Activities/ Fragments) / LifeCycle Observer(Components which look at others lifecycle)

03 Android ViewModel Tutorial Android Jetpack Components Hindi- CheezyCode #3

AGENDA
	What is ViewModel?
	Need of ViewModel
	Examples

Counter Application
	Counter looses data when configuration is changed(like from landscape to portrait)
	to take care of that so that we do not loose info we have view model

View Model
	- Model for your views such as Activity or Fragment
	- View Models are lifecycle aware
	- Data required for your screen is stored at one place i.e. ViewModel.
	  It may involve formatting that data in a particular format, accumulating data,
	  any logic in displaying this data in your UI


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04 Android ViewModel Factory Tutorial

AGENDA
	ViewModel Factory
	Use of ViewModel Factory
	Examples

For "ViewModel" we can not pass arguments directly to it as its objects are created 
by "ViewModelProvide" so we need ViewModelFactory when we need to pass arguments to viewModel

data -> ViewModelFactory -> ViewModel Object

07 Android Data Binding Tutorial

AGENDA
	Data Binding
	Examples

Data Binding
	- Support Library that allows you to bind UI components in your 
	layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format 
	rather than programatically

	Till now
	val emailTextView = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.email_text_view)
	emailTextView.text = model.emailAddress

	Updated
	<TextView android:yexy = "@{model.emailAddress}"

	- Benefits
		No need of "findViewById"
		Binding is compile time so no NULL pointer Exception
		Performance and No memory Leaks
